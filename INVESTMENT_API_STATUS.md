## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

Once UI is updated, test:

1. **New User Flow**:
   - Sign in → Should see 1M MTK balance
   - Select company → Should show $100.00 price
   - Invest $100K → Should get 1000 shares
   - Balance should decrease to $900K

2. **Price Dynamics**:
   - After first investment → Price should increase
   - Formula: Price = $100 × (1 + Total Volume / 1M)
   - Example: $200K invested → Price = $100 × 1.2 = $120/share

3. **Multiple Investments**:
   - Invest in same company twice → Shares should add up
   - Average purchase price should recalculate
   - Portfolio value should update

4. **Leaderboard**:
   - Should show 10 AI investors
   - Should show real users mixed with AI
   - Ranked by total wealth (available MTK + portfolio value)

5. **Company Rankings**:
   - Should update after investments
   - Companies ranked by total volume
   - Prices should reflect investment activity
