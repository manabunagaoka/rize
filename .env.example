# ============================================
# SSO AUTHENTICATION (MANABOODLE)
# ============================================

# No environment variables needed for SSO!
# The middleware.ts file handles all authentication automatically:
# - SSO endpoints are hosted on manaboodle.com
# - Middleware redirects users to login when needed
# - Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies
# - User data available via headers (x-user-id, x-user-email, etc.)

# SSO Flow:
# 1. User visits protected route → middleware checks for token
# 2. No token? → Redirect to https://manaboodle.com/sso/login
# 3. User logs in → Redirect back with sso_token
# 4. Middleware stores token in cookie
# 5. Future requests verified with manaboodle.com
# 6. User data injected into headers for your use

# ============================================
