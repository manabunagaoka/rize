## ‚öñÔ∏è LEGAL RISK ASSESSMENT

### Risk Level: **LOW** ‚úÖ

**Protected By**:
1. Multiple explicit disclaimers about virtual nature
2. Age verification preventing minor access
3. Educational framing throughout
4. No real money transactions
5. Free token distribution (not selling currency)
6. Clear service modification rights
7. Comprehensive limitation of liability
8. Informed consent requirement

**Remaining Considerations**:
- **Gambling Laws**: Not applicable (no real value, no prizes, educational game)
- **Securities Laws**: Not applicable (no actual equity, explicit disclaimer)
- **Consumer Protection**: Covered by free service, no purchase, clear disclaimers
- **Data Privacy**: GDPR/COPPA compliant with disclosure and user rights
- **Minors**: 13+ gate with parental consent requirement under 18

**Recommendation**: Legal framework is robust for MVP launch. Consider formal legal review before any future monetization (e.g., selling MTK for real money would require additional compliance).
