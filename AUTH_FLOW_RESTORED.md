# Authentication Flow - RESTORED ✅

## What Was Fixed

### Before (BROKEN):
- ❌ No login page visible
- ❌ Root redirected directly to `/competitions` without auth check
- ❌ Anyone could access competitions page
- ❌ No "Sign In" button anywhere
- ❌ Users locked out of the platform

### After (FIXED):
- ✅ **Public landing page at `/`**
  - Hero section with clear "Sign In" CTA
  - Preview of 4 legendary pitches (no voting without login)
  - Locked student startup section with "Sign In to Access"
  - If already logged in → auto-redirects to `/competitions`

- ✅ **Protected `/competitions` page**
  - Checks authentication on page load
  - Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
  - Shows competition toggle and full functionality only to logged-in users
  - Multi-competition platform intact

- ✅ **Login flow intact**
  - `/login` page with Manaboodle SSO button
  - Redirects to Academic Portal
  - Returns with auth cookies
  - User lands in `/competitions`

## User Flow

### New Visitor:
1. Lands on `/` → sees public landing page
2. Clicks "Sign In to Vote" → goes to `/login`
3. Clicks "Sign In with Manaboodle SSO" → redirects to Academic Portal
4. Logs in at Academic Portal → returns with cookies
5. Lands on `/competitions` → sees competition toggle + full platform

### Returning User:
1. Visits `/` → detects auth cookies → auto-redirects to `/competitions`
2. Immediately sees their dashboard

### Logged-Out User Trying to Access Competitions:
1. Tries to visit `/competitions` directly
2. Auth check fails → redirects to `/login`
3. Must authenticate to proceed

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### Immediate (Before Tomorrow's UI Fix):
1. **Run SQL fix in Supabase** - The `competition_stats` view needs `created_at` column
   - File: `/workspaces/rize/supabase/fix_competition_stats_view.sql`
   - Go to Supabase SQL Editor → paste and run
   - This will make the competition dropdown work

### Tomorrow's UI Fixes:
1. Remove emoji icons from competitions (🏆 🎓)
2. Use proper icons or leave blank
3. Fix toggle panel visibility
4. Test competition switching
5. Wire vote buttons to API
6. Add class verification for Harvard 2026 competition

## Technical Details

### Auth Check Implementation:
```typescript
// In /competitions page - client-side auth check
function useAuth() {
  useEffect(() => {
    async function checkAuth() {
      const response = await fetch('/api/vote-pitch');
      const data = await response.json();
      
      if (data.error === 'Not authenticated') {
        router.push('/login');
      }
    }
    checkAuth();
  }, []);
}
```

### Files Changed:
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Restored public landing page with auth-aware content
- `src/app/competitions/page.tsx` - Added auth guard with redirect

## Status: DEPLOYED ✅
- Pushed to GitHub: commit `55010f1`
- Vercel auto-deploy in progress
- Should be live in ~2 minutes

## Next Steps:
1. **YOU**: Run the SQL fix in Supabase (see `/workspaces/rize/supabase/fix_competition_stats_view.sql`)
2. **TOMORROW**: Fix UI (remove emojis, test toggle, connect vote buttons)
