### 3. Pricing Algorithm

```
Share Price = Base Price √ó (1 + Total Invested / 1,000,000)

Where:
- Base Price = $100
- Total Invested = Sum of all MTK invested in that company
```

**Example:**
- Facebook has $2M MTK invested
- Price = $100 √ó (1 + 2,000,000 / 1,000,000) = $100 √ó 3 = $300/share

1. **user_token_balances** - Token balances and portfolio totals
2. **user_investments** - Current holdings (positions)
3. **investment_transactions** - Full history of all trades
4. **pitch_market_data** - Real-time pricing and market stats

#### Views:
