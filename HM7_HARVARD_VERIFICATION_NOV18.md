## IMPACT

### Critical Issues:
1. **Marketing Claims are FALSE** - We've been telling users these are "Harvard-founded" when 71% are not
2. **Brand Integrity** - "Harvard Magnificent 7" name is misleading
3. **AI Trading System** - Built on false premise
4. **Database** - Contains incorrect founder stories and Harvard affiliations
5. **Legal Risk** - Making false claims about Harvard affiliation

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Stop using "HM7" branding** until we have real Harvard companies
2. **Rename to something accurate** - "Tech Magnificent 7" or "Startup Leaders 7"
3. **Update all marketing copy** - Remove Harvard claims
4. **Fix database records** - Correct founder stories
5. **Find real Harvard-founded public companies** to replace the 5 imposters

## NEXT STEPS

### Option 1: Rebrand as Non-Harvard Index
- Change "HM7" to "TM7" (Tech Magnificent 7) or "SL7" (Startup Leaders 7)
- Keep current 7 companies
- Remove all Harvard branding
- Update marketing: "7 legendary tech companies that changed the world"

### Option 2: Find 5 More Real Harvard Companies
- Keep META and MSFT (verified)
- Replace DBX, AKAM, RDDT, WRBY, BKNG with actual Harvard-founded companies
- Must be public, liquid, tradeable
- Challenge: Need to find 5 more that meet criteria

### Option 3: Expand to Top Universities
- Rebrand as "IVY7" or "ELITE7"
- Include Harvard (META, MSFT), MIT (DBX, AKAM), Stanford, etc.
- Celebrate top university innovation ecosystem
- More honest and inclusive

## REAL HARVARD-FOUNDED PUBLIC COMPANIES TO CONSIDER

Based on earlier research:

1. ✅ **META** (Facebook) - Mark Zuckerberg, Harvard
2. ✅ **MSFT** (Microsoft) - Bill Gates, Harvard
3. **SNAP** (Snapchat) - Evan Spiegel, Stanford (not Harvard)
4. **ZILLOW** (Z) - Rich Barton, Harvard '89 ✅
5. **HUBSPOT** (HUBS) - Brian Halligan, Harvard MBA '05 ✅
6. **TripAdvisor** (TRIP) - Langley Steinert, Harvard MBA ✅
7. **CarGurus** (CARG) - Langley Steinert, Harvard MBA ✅
