## 🎯 How It Works

### Competition Switching:
1. User visits `/competitions` (default: legendary)
2. Clicks dropdown → Sees all 3 competitions
3. Selects "Harvard 2026" → URL becomes `/competitions?competition=harvard-2026-main`
4. Page fetches student startups for that competition
5. Leaderboard updates with class submissions
6. Voting respects competition boundaries

### Leaderboard + Detail Flow:
1. Page loads → Fetches leaderboard data for active competition
2. Auto-selects #1 entry by default
3. User clicks row #3 → Detail panel updates to show pitch #3
4. User clicks "Next" → Moves to pitch #4
5. User clicks vote button → API checks competition permissions

### Movement Tracking:
- Stores previous rankings in component state
- Compares current rank vs. previous rank
- Shows ↑X (green) if moved up
- Shows ↓X (red) if moved down
- Shows → (gray) if no change
- Shows NEW (blue) if first votes
